# Disneyland Theme Park Annual Pass Purchase Program

## Description
A Python-based program to assist customers in purchasing Disneyland Theme Park Annual Passes and optional Parking Passes. The program calculates the total cost based on pass types, quantities, parking pass selections, and applicable discounts for Club 33 members.

## Motivation
This project was developed to simplify the process of calculating the total cost for Disneyland Annual Passes, offering an intuitive and engaging way for customers to make selections and see their final cost, including taxes and discounts.

## Why This Project?
The project was built to provide a user-friendly tool that integrates ticket and parking pass purchasing while applying relevant discounts and taxes. It showcases practical Python programming skills in handling input validation, conditional logic, and financial calculations.

## Problem Solved
Manually calculating the total cost of tickets, parking passes, and discounts can be error-prone and time-consuming. This program automates the process, ensuring accuracy and improving the customer experience.

## What I Learned
- Leveraging Python's control structures and dictionaries for efficient operations.
- Handling user input and managing input validation.
- Implementing real-world calculations, including discounts and tax applications.
- Structuring code for clarity and usability.

## Features
- **Pass Selection**: Choose from Silver, Gold, or Platinum passes.
- **Quantity Handling**: Specify the number of passes to purchase.
- **Parking Pass Option**: Optionally add annual parking passes.
- **Club 33 Discount**: Apply a 10% discount for Club 33 members.
- **Tax Calculation**: Automatically calculates the total with applicable taxes.
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive prompts and detailed outputs.

## Getting Started
1. Install Python (3.6 or newer).
2. Run the program using an IDE or terminal.
3. Follow the prompts to input selections and view the calculated total.

## What Makes This Project Stand Out?
- Accurate, real-time calculations with comprehensive error handling.
- Personalized experience with user prompts and responses.
- Modular and easy to extend for additional features, such as online payment integration.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- IDLE or any Python-compatible IDE

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the program using `python Project1.py`.
3. Follow the interactive prompts to select pass types, add-ons, and discounts.   

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface for better accessibility.
- Include additional pass options or seasonal promotions.
- Expand functionality for group discounts or multi-day passes.
